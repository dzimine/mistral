*tox -evenv -- python mistral/cmd/api.py --config-file path_to_config*

Note that an example configuration file can be found in etc/mistral.conf.example.

### Running Mistral Task Executors
To run Mistral Task Executor instance perform the following command in a shell::

*tox -evenv -- python mistral/cmd/task_executor.py --config-file path_to_config*

Note that at least one Executor instance should be running so that workflow tasks are processed by Mistral.

    [DEFAULT]
    rpc_backend = fake

    engine = mistral.engine.local.engine

    mistral/cmd/run.py --config-file etc/mistral.conf --use-debugger
